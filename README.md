# Wasm-Adventures
a repository for all of my wasm adventures and experiments!


### This project was built using emscripten! I downloaded and installed it with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh).
It only takes one shell command and it does all of the path buisness. I'm tired so sorry for the trash explaination.

I also tried to use Swiftwasm for the swift files, but my machine is not working with the latest xcode version yet, 
so I was unable to install all of the tooling :(.
